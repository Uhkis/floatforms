# floatforms

floatforms is a jQuery plugin to make long forms a bit nicer to fill out.
Currently only works for `<input>` elements.

Demo and more at the [homepage](http://uhkis.github.io/floatforms/)

### Usage

Link the js (and optionally css) file(s) to your page:
```
<script src="js/floatforms.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/floatforms.css">
```

Add an element as your floatbox, currently id must be floatbox.
```
<div id="floatbox"></div>
```

Run the floatforms function on your form: `$('#yourform').floatforms();`
